# 🎬 Netflix-Style Movie Recommendation System

This machine learning project implements a movie recommendation system using content-based and collaborative filtering approaches, inspired by platforms like Netflix.

---

## 📌 Objective

To recommend relevant movies to users based on their past preferences and movie similarities using data science and machine learning techniques.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Cosine Similarity, NearestNeighbors)  
- NLP (TF-IDF Vectorization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for insights)

---

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Performed EDA on Netflix-style movie metadata (title, genre, description, ratings)
- Engineered features using text-based columns (e.g. `overview`, `tags`)  
- Built a **content-based filtering** model using **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity**
- Built a **collaborative filtering** demo using NearestNeighbors
- Created a user-friendly movie lookup to generate top 5 recommendations

---

## ✅ Outcome

The system successfully recommends similar movies based on content features and user preference patterns. It's lightweight, scalable, and extendable to large-scale datasets.
